I'm making this apps as a practice to sharpen my skills in replicating the design wireframe. I also really like the UI/UX of the  DigitalOcean landing page which has this kind of card style UI and icon illustration to explaining their products. This kind of UI involving lots of grid css.</p>\n<h2>Technology Used</h2>\n<p>For building this project I'am using HTML5, vanilla css for some specific styling, <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">TailwindCSS</a> for majority styling, vanilla JavaScript for making the responsive navigation bar, <a href=\"https://picsum.photos/\">Lorem Picsum</a> for generating the photos in the website, and <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com\">Font-Awesome</a> for adding the icon and illustration in the page.</p>\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>The UI/UX of this website involving massive use of grid css and making grid with just plain css is quite tidious jobs, not to mention this website is also fully responsive, so instead of using vanilla css I'm using css framework Tailwind CSS for the majority of styling. Tailwind CSS is low level css framework so it's very flexible to style the page with the style we want and making the website page responsive so easily.</p>","frontmatter":{"stack":"HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT","title":"GreenCloud"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"green-cloud-page"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
